### 1. What
**Random Forest**: A collection (or "forest") of many decision trees working together.

### 2. Why
- **More accurate**: Multiple trees vote on the answer.
- **Reduces mistakes**: Errors from one tree can be corrected by others.
- **Handles lots of data**: Works well with large datasets.

### 3. How
1. **Create many trees** using random parts of the data.
2. **Each tree makes a decision**.
3. **Combine their decisions** for the final answer.

### 4. Use
- **Health**: Diagnosing complex diseases.
- **Banking**: Fraud detection or loan approval.
- **Environment**: Predicting rainforest animal populations.

### 5. Without It
- **Less accuracy**: Single decision trees can make more mistakes.
- **Overfitting risk**: One tree might be too specific to training data.
- **Loss of strength in numbers**: Multiple trees together often outperform just one.
